# Wielomiany (Polynomials)

Task from Individual Programing Project course at my uni.

## Build

To build project clone this repo, then run following commands:
```
    mkdir release
    cd release
    cmake ..
    make
    make doc
    make test
```
This will create executable file `poly`, docs and executable file `poly_test` contains tests of `poly` library.
